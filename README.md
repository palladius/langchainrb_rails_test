# README

This app is cerated to test https://github.com/andreibondarev/langchainrb_rails in a sample app.

Currently the gem/docs seem broken (https://github.com/andreibondarev/langchainrb_rails/issues/20) so I'll pause this project for a while :  and keep working on my semantic search.

## Rails readme

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: `3.1.2`
* Rails: 7.0.8 (still Dockerfile missing :/)
* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation: `pgsql`
* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
